- Tests the retrieval of episode information based on episode IDs.
- Verifies that the API responses match the expected data.

### ID Tests

- Contains positive and negative tests for character IDs.
- Verifies character information retrieval based on character IDs.
- Handles both positive scenarios with valid character IDs and negative scenarios with invalid character IDs.

### Location Tests

- Located in `tests/test_location.py`.
- Tests the retrieval of location information based on location names.
- Verifies that the API responses match the expected data.

## Overview of `test_execution.py`

- `test_execution.py` is designed to execute different sets of tests.
- It allows you to specify which types of tests you want to run with various command-line options.
- The script uses multithreading to execute tests concurrently, and the level of parallelism can be configured based on the selected test options.

This script relies on the following Python modules:

- [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) for CLI handling.
- `subprocess` for executing test commands
- `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for multithreading

## Available options for `test_execution.py`
- `--test_episode`: To run episode tests
- `--test_id`: To run id tests
- `--test_location`: To run location tests
- `--all_tests`: To run all tests

## Accessing Help

To view the built-in help documentation for the `test_execution.py` script, you can use the following command:
